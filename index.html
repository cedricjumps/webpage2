				I am a senior at Graceland University. I am also a track athlete. Throughout this web page, I will go over my interests, my different track achievements, and what I plan on doing in the future. This page will be an outlet for me to show off my newly learned skills at webpage development as well as give you an insight on who I am as a person.

				A little background info on me:

</br>

I am a 21 year old senior here at Graceland University. I am originally from Greenville, Ms. I lived there until I was in the 8th grade then I moved to McPherson, Ks. It took a wile to get adjusted to Kansas, but eventually I did; through finding my love for sports.

</br>

Football was my early passion. I played two years of JV and Varsity in high school ending my sophomre year early due to injury. That's when I found my passion for track and field. Having never competing befofe I was nervous. Turned out to be a natural at the sport. 

</br>

I ended up making it to state; to only break my wrist two days before in a freak accident being left unable to compete. To make matters worse, my father got a job a Graceland Univeristy causing me to move my senior year. 

</br>

Moving to Iowa was a big change. I went from 5A to 1A and my entire life was changed. All wasn't bad though. I got the oppurtunity to play football once again and tried something new by playing basketball. When it came to track I rose back to my former self by making it to the big stage finally. 

</br>

Soon after Graceland gave me an offer. I intially declined. You see; I had offers from a lot bigger schools when I was back in Kansas being ranked 9th in the entire state overall. Tbat soon changed after the injury, and a lot more dropped when I moved out of state. I waited around and look and look but no other offer was the one I wanted. So I took a leap of faith and signed with graceland.
